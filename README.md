# CapiBridge
CapiBridge acts as a bridge between different communication technologies LoRa, ESP-NOW, and WiFi by receiving JSON strings from LoRa, and ESP-NOW and publishing them to an MQTT server. It automatically separates the data into dynamic topics based on keys within the JSON, such as "b" for battery or "m" for motion, making it highly compatible with Home Assistant. This gateway simplifies adding new DIY nodes/sensors to your smart home by standardizing the communication protocol across all projects, focusing on simplicity and unified protocol handling.

JSON String example
`{\"k\":\"key\",\"id\":\"node_name\",\"b\":\"3.2v\",\"rw\":\"row_string\"}`

### _Contributors_

> [!NOTE]
>  If you're ready to contribute to the project, your support would be greatly appreciated. Due to time constraints, I may not be able to quickly verify new "features" or completely new "code" functionality, so please create a new code/script in the new folder.
